# Hi, I’m Andrea 👋

**Management engineering graduate** focused on **startup finance** and **management control**.

Right now I’m building a public portfolio on:

- 🧮 **Budgeting & scenario planning** for early-stage startups  
- 📊 **KPI systems** that actually help founders make decisions  
- 🔥 **Cash burn & runway** patterns (what kills startups, what saves them)  
- 💸 **Cost structure & unit economics** by business model (SaaS, e-commerce…)

## 🔍 Main project: *What Works, What Doesn’t in Startup Management Control*

> A public, opinionated collection of models, scenarios and mini-papers  
> on what tends to work (and what doesn’t) in startup budgeting and control.

- 📁 Repo: [`what-works-what-doesnt-startup-control`](https://github.com/andrea-trenti/what-works-what-doesnt-startup-control)
- 📊 Tools: Excel, Python (soon), SQL, Power BI
- 📑 Output: models, 1-page summaries, slide decks, GitHub READMEs

## 🧱 Focus areas

- **Budgeting & scenarios** – base / best / worst, impact on runway and break-even  
- **KPI design** – few metrics that matter for founders & investors  
- **Cash burn** – what “good” and “bad” burn patterns look like  
- **Unit economics** – contribution margin and payback by business model
