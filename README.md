Hi, I'm Andrea 👋  

Industrial engineering graduate focused on **startup finance**, **management control** and **data-driven decision making**.

---

### 🧮 Focus areas

- **Budgeting & scenarios** – from simple operating budgets to multi-scenario models  
  (base / best / worst) to understand **runway, break-even and downside risk**.

- **KPI design & reporting** – selecting a **small set of actionable metrics**  
  for founders, operators and investors, and turning them into **clear dashboards**.

- **Cash burn & runway** – analyzing spending patterns, identifying **structural vs. discretionary** costs, and translating them into **runway, dilution and fund-raising needs**.

- **Unit economics** – contribution margin, payback and lifetime value by **business model**  
  (transactional vs. recurring, B2B vs. B2C, product vs. service).

- **Management control** – basic **planning & control** stack for early-stage companies:  
  forecast → actuals → variance analysis → decisions.

---

### 🎓 Background

- **BSc in Industrial Engineering** – focus on operations, statistics and applied economics.  
- Experience in **finance & analytics** within an international **food & beverage** environment.  
- Comfortable working between **Excel / spreadsheets**, basic **BI tools**, and  
  more qualitative **strategy / narrative**.

---

### 🧠 How I think

- Prefer **few numbers that matter** over long reports that nobody reads.  
- Mix of **engineering mindset** (systems, constraints, data) and **business pragmatism**  
  (what actually moves the needle for the company).  
- Strong interest in how finance, incentives and product decisions interact in  
  **startups and growth companies**.

---

### 🚀 Interests

- **Startups & venture capital** – especially product-driven companies where  
  business model and unit economics are as important as the technology.  
- **Analytics & decision support** – turning raw data into **simple, robust structures**  
  founders can use week after week.  
- **Strategy & operations** – how small teams can design **lightweight processes**  
  without killing speed.
